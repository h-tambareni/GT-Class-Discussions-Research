### Initial Data Cleaning in PostGre SQL ###

SELECT * FROM piazza.cs6601_np_anonymized 
WHERE (subject is not null
and subject not like ‘%Student Introductions%’
and subject not like ‘%Search for Teammates!%’)
and (folders is not null)
and (submission_html_removed is not null)
and (length(submission_html_removed) > 20);

### Creating New Table for KNN Model ###

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_excel('pizza data user roles.xlsx')

followup_df = df[df['Part of Post'].str.contains("followup", na=False)]
replyToFollowup_df = df[df['Part of Post'].str.contains("reply_to_followup", na=False)]

followup_count = followup_df.groupby('final_grades').size()
replyToFollowup_count = replyToFollowup_df.groupby('final_grades').size()

followup_count = followup_count.rename_axis('Final Grades').reset_index(name='# of Posts')
replyToFollowup_count = replyToFollowup_count.rename_axis('Final Grades').reset_index(name='# of Replies')

print(followup_count)
print(replyToFollowup_count)

combined_df = pd.merge(followup_count, replyToFollowup_count, on='Final Grades', how='outer')
print(combined_df)
combined_df.to_csv("StudentRepliesAndPosts.csv", index=False)
